This section deals with the monitoring configuration regarding to which components of the software are analyzed and afterwards visualized.

1. Set Up Kieker

1.1 Download the monitoring component from [here](https://build.se.informatik.uni-kiel.de/jenkins/job/kieker-monitoring/job/kieker/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/libs/kieker-1.14-SNAPSHOT-aspectj.jar).
1.2 Download 

1. The monitoring configuration file **aop.xml** resides in the folder `META-INF` which is stored in your application server’s (lib) folder. 

   In our example the file aop.xml resides in the file C:\Program" "files\Apache" "Software" "Foundation\Tomcat" "8.5\lib\explorviz-monitoring.jar.

2. Open the jar file with an extractor for example winzip or winrar. Navigate to the folder **META-INF** and extract the file **aop.xml**.
   
    _Hint: You can use an editor to open the file._

3. Open the extracted file **aop.xml** and update the `<include within="*"/>` statement according to your needs. For instance replace it with: `<include within="com.ibatis..*" />` to monitor only method calls in the com.ibatis package and its subpackages. Add further `<include within="more.packages..*“/>` statements below to include more than one package. The mentioned statement and especially the last advice is shown in the picture below.

4. After modifying the file just replace it in the jar file.
	
   _Hint: The server on which ExplorViz is monitored has to be terminated._
