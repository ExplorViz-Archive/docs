The following sections describe how to monitor a java application in two different ways
### Start monitoring java applications with Eclipse:
1. Click right on your project, go to **Run as** and select **Run Configuration**.
2. Open the tab **Arguments** and add the following instruction to the category **VM arguments**:
    
    _-javaagent: yourpath\lib\explorviz-monitoring.jar_
    
    **important:** _yourpath_ has to contain the absolute path to the file explorviz-monitoring.jar which resides in                                                         your server’s lib folder.

    In our example it looks like this:

    _-javaagent:C\Programme\Apache" "Software" "Foundation\Tomcat" „8.5\lib\explorviz-monitoring.jar_

![eclipse](https://github.com/ExplorViz/Docs/blob/master/images/eclipse.png)

3. Run the main class with the new configuration.
4. Start your Chrome Browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).
5. Get access to ExplorViz by clicking **Sign In** without adding any login data.
6. Navigate to the tab **Visualization** and monitor your application.

	_Hint: It might take a few seconds until your application is monitored. Furthermore relaunch the monitored application if the data stream was incomplete._

### Start monitoring java applications with windows command-line:
1. Export your project as an executable jar file. For details see [this documentation ](https://github.com/ExplorViz/Docs/wiki/Creating-an-executable-jar-file).
2. Open the command-line and enter following instruction:
    
    _java -javaagent: yourpath\lib\explorviz-monitoring.jar -jar jarpath\filename.jar_

    _yourpath_ has to contain the absolute path to the file explorviz-monitoring.jar which resides in your server’s lib folder. jarpath has to contain the absolute path to the target jar file.

    In our example it looks like this:

    _java -javaagent:C:\Program" "files\Apache" "Software" "Foundation\Tomcat" "8.5\lib\explorviz-monitoring.jar -jar jarpath\filename.jar_

3. Start your Chrome Browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).
4. Get access to ExplorViz by clicking **Sign In** without adding any login data.
5. Navigate to the tab **Visualization** and monitor your application.
   
   _Hint: It might take a few seconds until your application is monitored. Furthermore relaunch the monitored application if the data stream was incomplete._
