`DEPRECATED documentation`

This documentation adresses ExplorViz Legacy. For our new architecture, please visit the [backend](https://github.com/ExplorViz/explorviz-backend) and [frontend](https://github.com/ExplorViz/explorviz-frontend).

***

This paragraph shows more configuration options to adapt ExplorViz to your expectations.

1. The ExplorViz configuration file **explorviz.live_trace_processing.default.properties** also resides in the file explorviz-monitoring.jar which is stored in your server’s lib folder. 

   In our example it resides in the file C:\Program" "files\Apache" "Software" "Foundation\Tomcat" "8.5\lib\explorviz-monitoring.jar.

2. Open the jar file with an extractor for example with winzip or winrar. Navigate to the **META-INF** folder and extract the file **explorviz.live_trace_processing.default.properties**.

3. Open the extracted file **explorviz.live_trace_processing.default.properties** and look up the the options in the table below.
	
   _Hint: You can use an editor to open the file. If you have formatting problems using windows editor alternatively use WordPad._

4. After modifying the file just replace it in the jar file.
	
   _Hint: The server on which ExplorViz is monitored has to be terminated._
	         _In case of authorization problems look into the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/ExplorViz/Docs/wiki/Troubleshooting)._
