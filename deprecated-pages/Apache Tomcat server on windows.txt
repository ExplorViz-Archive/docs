The following steps illustrate the installation and configuration of an Apache Tomcat 8.5 Server on windows. The path used in these steps depends on where you installed Apache Tomcat.

1. Download an [Apache Tomcat version](https://tomcat.apache.org) greater or equal 8.5.
2. Install Apache Tomcat without launching it at the end of the installation, otherwise you have to stop the service later. 


   _Hint: Don’t forget to select the correct path to Java Runtime Environment if you changed it in step 2._

3. Copy the file ROOT.war from ExplorViz Binaries to C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.5\webapps.

4. Copy the file explorviz-monitoring.jar from ExplorViz Binaries to C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.5\lib.

5. Delete the folder ROOT in C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.5\webapps.
