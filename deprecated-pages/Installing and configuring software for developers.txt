This section deals with the installation and configuration of the software which is necessary to use ExplorViz as a developer.

2. Download and extract the [Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages).

3. Start the IDE and install /Google Plugin for Eclipse/Google Plugin for Eclipse 4.4/4.5/4.6 and
/SDKs/Google Web Toolkit SDK 2.7.0. In order to install this components please visit [this page](https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/download), select the version of the IDE you are using and follow further instructions.  

4. Download the projects [Common](https://github.com/ExplorViz/common), [Analysis](https://github.com/ExplorViz/analysis), [Monitoring](https://github.com/ExplorViz/monitoring) and [ExplorViz (Server)](https://github.com/ExplorViz/ExplorViz) from Github.

   _Hint: Import the project ExplorViz (Server) as the last._

6. Wait until validation is complete and the working directory has build up properly. You can see                                                 the progress right next to the heap size in the picture below.
